        <h3>AWS Solutions Architect & Cloud Practitioner Teacher <i>(Jun 2024 – Present)</i></h3>
        <p>As an AWS Solutions Architect and Cloud Practitioner instructor, I create and deliver targeted lessons to prepare students for AWS certification success. My curriculum aligns with the AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) exam, focusing on essential AWS services like EC2, VPC, CloudFront, ELB, and Auto Scaling. I also prepare students for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam by providing foundational training in cloud computing, covering infrastructure essentials such as storage, compute, networking, and database management. After completing the Cloud Practitioner training, I transition students to DevOps concepts that support their preparation for the SAA exam, fostering a comprehensive understanding of AWS. Teaching over 30 students so far, I emphasize practical experience with hands-on labs in CloudFormation and Terraform, guiding them in infrastructure as code (IaC) principles for efficient cloud resource automation and provisioning. Additionally, I lead deep dives into AWS networking, teaching students to design secure, scalable VPC architectures and equipping them with the strategies needed for certification success.</p><br>
        <h3>DevOps Teacher <i>(Jun 2023 – Jun 2024)</i></h3>
        <p>In my role as a DevOps instructor, I taught more than 60 students through in-depth courses on core programming languages and frameworks, including Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Django, and Flask. My approach emphasized practical skills in REST API development, Git-based version control, and end-to-end project development, preparing students for careers as Full Stack Developers. Through interactive lectures, live demonstrations, and hands-on coding exercises, I guided students in completing full-stack projects involving Docker, Linux, and cloud-based applications. I also introduced them to CI/CD automation with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, giving them the tools to build scalable deployment pipelines and bridging academic learning with real-world development skills. Additionally, I mentored students in job search strategies, helping them apply their skills confidently in the job market.</p>
